Todo App Frontend
----This is the frontend for a Todo App built with React that performs basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It connects to a Django backend API for managing todos.

Features
        -Create Todo: Users can add new todos.
        -Read/View Todos: Users can view a list of their todos.
        -Update Todo: Users can edit the details of their todos.
        -Delete Todo: Users can delete todos they no longer need.

Getting Started
        1. Clone the Repository
            git clone "https://github.com/python-dev-rahul/notes-app-frontend.git"
            cd todo-frontend
        2. Install Dependencies
            Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:
                --npm install
3. Start the App
To start the app on http://localhost:3000, run:
        --npm start

4. Connect to the Backend
The app connects to a Django backend for data storage. Make sure your backend server is running and set the API URLs correctly in the frontend code.
